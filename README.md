A modern, web-based desktop operating system interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI.

## Features

- **Desktop Environment**: Windows 11-inspired grid layout, multi-select drag-and-drop, and fluid window management with snap-like behavior.
- **Window Management**: Minimize, maximize, close, and focus management with preserved state and independent navigation.
- **Virtual Filesystem**: Complete in-memory Linux-style filesystem (`/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, etc.) with permissions (Owner/Group/Others, Sticky Bit) and persistent storage.
- **User Management**: Multi-user support with bidirectional `/etc/passwd` syncing and dedicated Settings panel.
- **App Ecosystem**:
  - **Finder**: Full-featured file manager with breadcrumbs navigation, drag-and-drop file moving, and list/grid views.
  - **Terminal**: Zsh-like experience with autocomplete, command history, pipe support, and ability to launch GUI apps (`Finder /home`).
  - **Settings**: System control panel for Appearance (Accent Colors, Themes), Performance (Motion/Shadows), and Data Management (Soft/Hard Reset).
  - **Browser**: Functional web browser simulation with bookmarks, history, and tab management.
  - **Media**: Interactive Music, Messages, and Photos apps demonstrating UI patterns.
- **Security & Performance**:
  - **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP preventing XSS and `eval` execution in production.
  - **Debounced Persistence**: Efficiently saves state to localStorage without UI freezing.
  - **Native Integration**: Electron support with native window frame options and shell integration.
- **Customization**:
  - **Theming**: "2025" Color Palette with dynamic Neutral, Shades, and Contrast modes.
  - **Accessibility**: Reduce Motion and Disable Shadows options for lower-end devices.
